This post will be my visual journal while I am working on making my first foam and fibreglass surfboard. I'm going to be posting everything in here, including my production process, any inevitable mistakes I make and any things I learn from the experience. I'm hoping I can make a cool board if I do everything right.

The first step was to design the board on Shape3DX to get accurate dimensions and measurements for the rocker, thickness and finbox locations.

The finished board in imperial measurement. I think if I can follow this guide properly then the board should come out pretty good.

The round squash performer but this time in metric measurement, which I'll be using most of the time.

This is another helpful summary, giving me length, width, thickness and volume. The board should hopefully come out a little less than 28.5L.

What the board will hopefully look like when finished.

A wooden mal I made. Hopefully making this board gives me an advantage for this foam one.

The blank I'll be using from surfblanks australia.

The template I'll be cuting out onto mdf and then tracing onto the blank.
