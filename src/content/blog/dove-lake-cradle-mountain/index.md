I really wanted to do the cradle mountain summit walk, but I guess the lake would do while I was with my parents.

The old wooden boatshed. I managed to sneak a photo with nobody around.

The trees were so green. It helps when its raining here like half the year.

One of my favourite shots from the mountain. The water was completely calm in this brief window.
