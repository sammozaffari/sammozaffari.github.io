While we were staying at Coles bay, we went for a drive a little up the coast to see if there were any waves around, and to explore the beaches a little.

The waves were tiny, but the beach had sqeaky white sand, reminding me of the NSW south coast.

If there was a westerly wind there would have beach some clean mini waves.
