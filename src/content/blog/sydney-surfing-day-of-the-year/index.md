The week starting from 4th July was one to remember. Relentless east swell is not a regular occurence during winter in Sydney, but we'll take what we can get. Unfortunately I had to get my wisdom teeth out on the fifth so I only got to witness the first day of the swell which was probably the best anyway.

I got to North narra around 10:30 and it was just lines stacked to the horizon. I don't think I have ever seen beachbreak waves in Sydney this long. It was just hitting the bank perfectly. I flew the drone for a little bit to show how the dynamics of swell and sand were coming into play to make some fun waves.

Too many people out. This is only 1/4 of the crew.

The lefts were wayy better and much longer, as seen here.

Another view of the perfect, reeling sandbank.

Looks like an A-frame from above, but I bet the right closed out down the line. You can see how shallow it really is from this view.

If North Narrabeen was a right. Pure heaven right there.

Nice A-frame peak. This wave went on for 150m +.

An interesting vantage point I found from the lagoon. Shows the length of the wave well.

The first wave I saw when I rocked up at Turrimetta. Very nice.

I went and bush-bashed on the cliff to get some cool angles.

Frame 3. I really think the Northern beaches are a goofyfoot heaven when an east or northeast swell hit.

Lining up for a tube down the line.
