A nice, short period peaky ESE swell hit Sydney today and I just knew it would be pumping. We got to narrabeen at 7:30 and got out there straight away. 

It just kept getting better and better and I got one of the most fun lefts I've ever caught. When I got out of the water, sore from paddling for so long I took some snaps. The pics don't really do justice at how fun it was because it started getting a bit smaller when we got out.

The last frame. I thought surely that he would make this one but I guess not.

A nice little left nugget, just gotta get on on the shoulder.
