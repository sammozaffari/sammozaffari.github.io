The original plan was to spend a few days at Whitby's farm, which was a wild few days for sure. Ebikes, 4x4s, rolling cars, broken ankles, you name name it. 

Alex ended up breaking his ankle after riding through some cow shit on the motorbike. Ben rolled his car and wrote it off. Rory rolled the polaris. Can it get much better?

On the way to the farm before new buildings road we found a nice purple field.

Worth jumping over a barbed wire fence.

Trying to figure out how the heck we were going to get out.

The south coast was very green. They must have had some good rains before we arrived.

Another one.

Loading up the rodeo with the boys and the bikes. I think the rodeo is one of the most fun cars to be in. No brakes or power steering, just the way we like it.

Very hilly country. You can see the track we went up to get to the top of the knob in the far corner of the shot.

We woke up to this the next morning.

A few branches of this tree got demolished the day before.

Dead tree.

A view of our camping setup. Nothing but endless space.

Can you imagine the mtb tracks you could build here?

The farm has a few old beetles lying around. The chassis and motor were used to make buggies. I was trying to get a drone shot of Aidan doing a poo but he caught me.

Some unusual beams of light from the high up view.

Looks like a few mini-craters.
