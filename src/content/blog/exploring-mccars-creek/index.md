McCarrs Creek is a suburb that is located adjacent to McCarrs Creek, approximately 4 kilometres west of Newport, at the headwaters of the Pittwater in northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Recently, Joe and I went to there on numerous locations to try various types of new experimental shots, with mirrors, lights steel wool and drones. Here are some of the outtakes.

Photoshopped two versions of Joe standing next to eachother and flipped one and made it slightly smaller. Came out pretty cool!

Some nice light shining down the creek. I swam in it with my camera and water housing, despite the pretty cold and murky water.

Floating in the milky water trying to capture some cool mirror reflections.

A little creepy, not going to lie...

The water at Upper Gledhill falls was absolutely freezing. I think Joe got an icecream headache going underwater for this shot.

Charlie waving high up which made for a pretty sick shot.

In through the trees where the bats were. They went pretty crazy after this one.
