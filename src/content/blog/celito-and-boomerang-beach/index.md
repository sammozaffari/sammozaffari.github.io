On our second afternoon of trying to find waves on the Mid-North coast, we scouted out Celito and Boomerang Beach, and ultimately ended up surfing very fun Boomerang.

It was pretty much a rainforest. Apparently there is wild guava growing in the area.

Looking down the beach, having a 4x4 definitely is an advantage.
