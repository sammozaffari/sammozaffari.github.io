Before we headed up to Whitby's farm, we stopped off at Wolumla peak, which gave us panoramic views of the south coast mountains and provided a good spot for having lunch. I flew the drone up over the tower to try give some perspective of how high we were.

On top of the tower. Perfect for fire spotting.

Some of the greenest grass I've ever seen on the way to the peak.

The drives around here never get boring when you have these views.

The were towering high even while we were standing on the tower. Definitely blocking some of the view.
