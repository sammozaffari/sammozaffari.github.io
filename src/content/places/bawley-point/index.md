Bawley Point is a little town on the South Cost of New South Wales, Australia, in the Shoalhaven area, with a population of 698 people at the 2016 census. It's around 30 minutes south of Ulladulla, New South Wales, and 30 minutes north of Batemans Bay on the South Coast of NSW.

## **Local history**

Around 20,000 years ago, the landscape of Bawley Point was far different that it now is today. The most noticeable is the lack of ocean, which wouldn't have even been visible from the area. The sea level was a 14 kilometres further out. The climate would have been cold and dry, with ocean water captured in the massive polar ice caps. Instead of the ocean, there's large rolling plains with rocky ridges and hills, covered in trees, providing food and shelter for Australia's megafauna: giant kangaroos, wombats and diprotodons.

## **Best places to eat**

**Bean at Burrill Cafe**

Corner Princes Hwy and, Balmoral Rd, Burrill Lake NSW 2539

This cafe is about a 17 minute drive from Bawley Point, it had great food and I would definetely go back there again.

**Hayden's Pies**

2/166 PRINCES HWY, ULLADULLA

While this shop is in Ulladulla, they have some of the best pies in Australia, you'll want to buy two as I personally think that one isn't filling enough. Try the morrocan pie, it's definetely the best.
