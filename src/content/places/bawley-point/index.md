Bawley Point is a little town on the South Cost of New South Wales, Australia, in the Shoalhaven area, with a population of 698 people at the 2016 census. It's around 30 minutes south of Ulladulla, New South Wales, and 30 minutes north of Batemans Bay on the South Coast of NSW.

## **Local history**

Around 20,000 years ago, the landscape of Bawley Point was far different that it now is today. The most noticeable is the lack of ocean, which wouldn't have even been visible from the area. The sea level was a 14 kilometres further out. The climate would have been cold and dry, with ocean water captured in the massive polar ice caps. Instead of the ocean, there's large rolling plains with rocky ridges and hills, covered in trees, providing food and shelter for Australia's megafauna: giant kangaroos, wombats and diprotodons.

These next set of images are from the Meroo lake and Meroo headland area, with multiple different walks and so many different things to see/beaches to surf at, this place is definetely a must if you're in the area.

Reflections on the Meroo lake walking track, bit of a vague track and ended up bushbashing to get any proper view of the lake

A nice beach at meroo headland, with nuggan head in the background. This would be a good surf spot when the swell is up and also easy to escape the crowds here.

The walking track towards the lookout on Meroo headland was stunningly green.

The hidden cove around the corner from the beach that you can walk around from on the rocks.

Next up is the things you can see at Pretty beach and the snapper point walking track. We had to resort to doing all the walking tracks as the waves were no good. Probably wouldn't have been very productive on this trip if the waves had actually been good.

## Best places to eat


#### Bean at Burrill Cafe
Corner Princes Hwy and, Balmoral Rd, Burrill Lake NSW 2539

This cafe is about a 17 minute drive from Bawley Point, it had great food and I would definetely go back there again.

#### Hayden's Pies
2/166 PRINCES HWY, ULLADULLA

While this shop is in Ulladulla, they have some of the best pies in Australia, you'll want to buy two as I personally think that one isn't filling enough. Try the morrocan pie, it's definetely the best
